# Network Speed Test

This is a simple network speed test application built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It allows users to check their internet download and upload speeds in real-time. The application runs in the browser and uses JavaScript to gather speed information by testing the connection to a server.

## Features

- **Check Download Speed**: Measures the time it takes to download a file from a server to the user's device.
- **Check Upload Speed**: Measures the time it takes to upload a file from the user's device to a server.
- **Simple UI**: User-friendly interface to display the results of the speed tests.
- **Real-Time Results**: Display download and upload speeds in Mbps (Megabits per second).

## Technologies Used

- **HTML**: Structure of the application.
- **CSS**: Styling of the application.
- **JavaScript**: Handles the speed test logic and communication with the server.

## How It Works

1. The user clicks on the "Start Test" button.
2. The application measures the download speed by downloading a small file from a test server.
3. The upload speed is measured by uploading a file to a test server.
4. The results (download and upload speeds) are displayed to the user in Mbps.
